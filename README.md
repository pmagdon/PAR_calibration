# Calibration script for custom build Photosynthetic Acitve Radiaton (PAR) Sensors

This script was used to calulate the calibration factors of custom build PAR sensors.Therefore, an installation with a charge of custom PAR sensors and two calibrated LiCOR PAR sensors was setup and parallel measurements were conducted over a longer time period.

The script generates a pdf report using the brew package with one page for each calibrated sensor. 

To create the report run the file Compile_report.R
